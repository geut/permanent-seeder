> This is the Permanent Seeder SDK repository

The Permanent Seeder is not just a CLI tool. It does lots of things. To do this we need to coordinate different processes.

Here you can find all of the services that make the Permanent Seeder work. They are exposed together as an SDK that the cli can consume.

We are using [`moleculer`](https://moleculer.services/) internally to comunicate with this set of services.
